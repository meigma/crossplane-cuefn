## 2026-06-27 21:28 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: not yet stated. Session opened via `/session-new`; awaiting the developer's first request.
Current state of the world: fresh repository `meigma/crossplane-cuefn` at initial commit (`dc4068a`) on `master`. Top-level holds a Go project scaffold (`cmd/`, `internal/`, `go.mod`), build/release tooling (`apko.yaml`, `melange.yaml`, `mise.toml`, `moon.yml`, `release-please-config.json`), docs, and the session/journal protocol. Journal branch `journal/jmgilman` initialized. No prior sessions.
Plan: wait for the developer to state a goal, then record it and proceed.

## 2026-06-27 21:30 — Goal: ramp on Crossplane v2 + CUE before build brief
Developer asked me to familiarize myself with two technology areas before they explain what we're building:
- Crossplane v2: composite functions (Go), Compositions, Configurations.
- CUE: basics (types, constraints, structs) and CUE modules (publishing/consuming via a container/OCI registry).
The repo name (`crossplane-cuefn`) strongly hints we're building a Crossplane composition function that uses CUE. Doing grounded research now; the actual build brief comes next.

## 2026-06-27 21:45 — Ramp complete; key findings
Loaded skills `git`, `worktrunk`, `cue`. Repo base is the `meigma/template-go` scaffold (module path still `github.com/meigma/template-go`; Cobra/Viper CLI; mise-pinned tooling: go 1.26.4, golangci-lint, moon, melange 0.54, apko 1.2.19, cosign 3.1.1; melange+apko+cosign supply-chain for signed Wolfi apk → OCI image). CUE v0.16.1 available locally. No crossplane CLI installed yet.

Current versions: Crossplane **v2.3** (docs.crossplane.io/latest), function-sdk-go uses `proto/v1` (GA) + `crossplane-runtime/v2`.

Crossplane v2 essentials:
- XRs are **namespaced by default**; XRD `apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v2` adds `scope: Namespaced|Cluster|LegacyCluster`. **Claims are gone** (LegacyCluster keeps v1 behavior). XRs put machinery under `spec.crossplane` (compositionRef, resourceRefs, etc.).
- XRs can compose **any** resource (MRs, native k8s, third-party CRDs). MRs can be namespaced.
- **Native patch-and-transform is removed** — Compositions are `mode: Pipeline` only, a sequence of `pipeline:` steps each with a `functionRef` (+ optional `input`), passing desired state and shared `context` down the chain.
- Composition is still `apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1`, `compositeTypeRef` binds it to an XRD kind.

Go composition function (function-sdk-go):
- Implement `RunFunction(ctx, *fnv1.RunFunctionRequest) (*fnv1.RunFunctionResponse, error)`.
- `rsp := response.To(req, response.DefaultTTL)`; read with `request.GetObservedCompositeResource(req)`, `request.GetDesiredComposedResources(req)`, `request.GetInput(req, in)`; XR has typed getters `GetString`/`GetStringArray`/etc by field path.
- Build desired resources, `composed.From(typedMR)` → unstructured, `desired[resource.Name("...")] = &resource.DesiredComposed{Resource: cd}`, then `response.SetDesiredComposedResources(rsp, desired)`. Status/UX via `response.ConditionTrue/False(...).TargetComposite()`, `response.Warning(...)`, `response.Fatal(...)`.
- Input type lives in `input/v1beta1/`, kubebuilder markers + `go generate` (controller-gen deepcopy). `main.go`/`Dockerfile` are boilerplate. Tests: table-driven with `protocmp`, `resource.MustStructJSON`.
- Package: `docker build` runtime image → `crossplane xpkg build --package-root=package --embed-runtime-image=...` → `crossplane xpkg push`. Local test loop: `crossplane composition render` (no cluster), or `Development` runtime annotation.

Configurations: OCI packages bundling XRDs+Compositions; `crossplane.yaml` (`meta.pkg.crossplane.io/v1`, kind `Configuration`) with `spec.dependsOn` (Functions/Providers/Configurations + version constraints). The three package types: Provider, Function, Configuration.

CUE side:
- Modules: `cue.mod/module.cue`, `cue mod init --source=git <path>@v0`, `cue mod tidy`, `cue vet -c`, `cue export`. Publish to OCI: `cue login`, `CUE_REGISTRY=host/prefix`, `cue mod publish vX.Y.Z` (CUE module artifact, NOT a runnable image). Consume: `cue mod get`, `CUE_REGISTRY` mapping, imports + `cue mod tidy`.
- Go API (the CUE↔function crux): `cuecontext.New()`, `load.Instances()` + `ctx.BuildInstance()`; for registry-backed module deps use `modconfig.NewRegistry(nil)` wired into `load.Config{Registry: ...}`; `mod/modregistry` reads/writes CUE modules from an OCI registry.

Prior art (study, don't necessarily copy):
- `crossplane-contrib/function-cue` — runs inline CUE scripts; injects `#request: {observed, desired, context}`, CUE returns a RunFunctionResponse-shaped value. **Inline source only today**; has `fn-cue-tools` (openapi, extract-schema, package-script via `cue def --inline-imports`, cue-test). There's also an archived predecessor (`function-cue-archived`).
- `crossplane-contrib/function-kcl` — analogous KCL function; notably DOES load modules from OCI/Git. This is the likely differentiator if our goal is CUE-modules-from-a-registry.

Open question for the developer: what specifically is the build brief, and how does it differ from `function-cue` (my guess: first-class CUE **modules consumed from an OCI registry**, leveraging this repo's supply-chain tooling).

## 2026-06-27 22:05 — Brief confirmed (see TECH_NOTES "Project" section)
Developer confirmed the build. Two halves: (1) runtime Go function that pulls a CUE module from OCI, injects XR spec + EnvironmentConfig under a well-known path, renders k8s objects; (2) operator CLI that does CUE→OpenAPI→XRD and packages/pushes a Configuration from the same module, plus a bonus XR-validate command. Full description recorded in TECH_NOTES.

Key design decisions / risks I flagged back to the developer (to resolve before/while building):
- (A) CUE→OpenAPI structural-schema fidelity — K8s CRDs require *structural* OpenAPI v3; not all CUE (disjunctions, custom error(), some regex) maps cleanly. Biggest unknown. `cuelang.org/go/encoding/openapi` is the tool; may need feature constraints on the schema portion + post-processing.
- (B) Pulling the *main* CUE module from OCI at runtime — CUE module tooling is built to pull *dependencies*, not evaluate a fetched root module. Needs a spike: `mod/modregistry` client to fetch+unpack, then `load.Instances` with `modconfig` registry for transitive deps. Cache by digest; pin by digest.
- (C) Reusing Crossplane's xpkg build/push for the Configuration — may live under `internal/` (non-importable). Fallbacks: shell out to `crossplane` CLI, or build the xpkg OCI artifact with go-containerregistry per the xpkg media-type spec.
- (D) The injection/output contract — exact well-known paths for XR spec, EnvironmentConfig, and returned resources; how desired-composed-resource *names* (stable keys) are derived; whether the module also returns XR status; readiness handling (function-auto-ready vs in-module).
- (E) EnvironmentConfig sourcing — read from pipeline context (key `apiextensions.crossplane.io/environment`, populated by function-environment-configs upstream) vs fetching EnvironmentConfigs ourselves via required resources.
- (F) Version/digest lock-step — generated XRD/Configuration must pin the exact module digest it was generated from, so schema and runtime transformation never drift.
- Repo fit: template-go already has Cobra/Viper → operator CLI = cobra subcommands; runtime function = server binary (shared CUE engine core). melange/apko/cosign → sign function image (and maybe module/Configuration).

## 2026-06-27 22:30 — Reviewed reference spike; runtime half proven
Read the full spike at catalyst-infra .../platform/mvp/cuefn (details + adopted stack in TECH_NOTES "Reference spike"). Verdict: the **runtime half is done and clean** — adopt `internal/render` (Engine + ModuleLoader/OCILoader/LocalLoader), the `input{spec,metadata,environment}`→`resources` contract, the JSON-marshal/float trick, the OCI modregistry loader, and the fn.go wiring largely as-is. Resolves my open questions B (module pull — solved), D (contract — defined, minus strict schema), E (env from context — confirmed, needs function-environment-configs upstream).

The **DX half is the green-field** we build: (1) formalize a "module contract v2" with a strict `#Spec` + API metadata so one module drives everything; (2) CLI `generate` (CUE→OpenAPI→XRD via `encoding/openapi`); (3) `package/publish` (wrap XRD + generated Composition into a Configuration, xpkg build/push — shell out like the spike, import Crossplane as stretch); (4) bonus `validate` (XR vs `#Spec`). Plus repo-ification: rename module path to `github.com/meigma/crossplane-cuefn`, add deps, swap ko→melange/apko/cosign, function server + cobra CLI sharing `internal/render`.

Remaining real risks: A (CUE→OpenAPI structural-schema fidelity — still the top unknown, spike never did codegen so untested), transitive OCI deps, digest lock-step (F). Next: align with developer on module-contract-v2 shape and whether to start with a codegen spike (de-risk A) before scaffolding the repo.

## 2026-06-27 23:15 — Codegen spike done; risk A retired
Ran the CUE→OpenAPI→XRD codegen spike (scratch `…/scratchpad/codegen-spike`), validated with the API server's own structural-schema validator. **It works** — a realistic `#Spec` produces an XRD a cluster would accept. Full findings + the two implementation gotchas (ExpandReferences bug; regular-field rejection) + the author guardrail (no type-crossing/struct disjunctions) + the validated module-contract-v2 shape are in TECH_NOTES "Codegen de-risk spike". Risk A is retired; the single scariest unknown is now a solved, ~80-LOC recipe.

Next decision point for the developer: proceed to scaffold the real repo (rename module path → github.com/meigma/crossplane-cuefn, add proven deps + internal/render from the spike, stand up internal/schema codegen from this spike, cobra CLI skeleton), and pick the first build slice. Remaining unknowns are now lower-risk: transitive OCI module deps, xpkg/Configuration packaging (shell vs import), digest lock-step.

## 2026-06-28 00:30 — Repo rebrand template-go → crossplane-cuefn (PR #3)
Per developer request, branded the repo off the template-go scaffold (no product code yet). Plan: `/Users/josh/.claude/plans/let-s-just-proceed-with-wise-nygaard.md` (approved). Worked in worktree `.wt/chore-rebrand` off origin/master.

Decisions: binary `cuefn` (env prefix `CUEFN`); image/repo-ish names → `crossplane-cuefn` (GHCR `ghcr.io/meigma/crossplane-cuefn`); dual-license **Apache-2.0 OR MIT**; reset versioning → **0.1.0**.

Done: module path → `github.com/meigma/crossplane-cuefn`; `cmd/template-go`→`cmd/cuefn`; `internal/templateinfo`→`internal/appinfo`; rebranded moon/goreleaser/ghd/melange/apko/mise/release-please/workflows + `.github/scripts/*` (incl. tests) + vendored apko/melange/mise SKILL.md; rewrote README/docs/SECURITY; regen `docs/uv.lock`; `is_template=false`; added LICENSE-APACHE/MIT; removed DELETE_ME.md.

Scope notes: the 3 exploration agents missed `.github/scripts/` and `.agents/skills/` — both carried template-go names; rebranded them too (kept the Python tests green). Deferred (NOT done): Crossplane **xpkg** packaging adaptation (template still builds a normal GHCR image), and all engine/CLI code.

Verified: `git grep template-go` = 0 hits; `go build/test`, `gofmt` clean; `.github/scripts` py tests 11/11; `goreleaser check` ok; `moon run root:check` all 7 tasks pass (incl. strict docs build). Opened **PR #3** (https://github.com/meigma/crossplane-cuefn/pull/3); CI running. `.wt/chore-rebrand` worktree stays until merge.

## 2026-06-28 00:45 — Rebrand merged
PR #3 squash-merged to master (`29685c2`); worktree removed, local+remote `chore/rebrand` deleted, local master fast-forwarded. Sanity on master: module path, `cmd/cuefn`, `internal/appinfo`, zero template-go residue, DELETE_ME gone, dual LICENSE present. Repo is now cleanly branded; ready to start engine/CLI + xpkg work.

Next: land xpkg packaging + start the engine (`internal/render` from the spike) and `internal/schema` codegen (from the de-risk spike) behind cobra subcommands.
